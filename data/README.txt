Bias Survey Results:

Respondents were asked to rate the fairness of four hand-picked features from the bail, unemployment, hospital, and loan domains. The fairness of each feature is rated as either 'Very Unfair', 'Unfair', 'Somewhat Unfair', 'Neutral', 'Somewhat Fair', 'Fair', or 'Very Fair'.

Mentioned - the terms 'Machine Learning Computer Program' were explicitly mentioned and the question framed as if computers are aiding in the decision making process.
NotMentioned - No mention of machine learning or computers is made and the question is framed as if humans are making the decisions.

First Survey Results:

Respondents were given the description for their domain, and then were asked to rate the fairness of each feature and explain why by checking any of the eight properties or filling in their own.

Domain - The respondents randomly assigned domain of rec (recidivism/bail), unem (unemployment), cps (child protective services), hos (hospital), loan, or ins (insurance).
MLBias - Whether or not the words 'Machine Learning' and 'Computer' were explicitly mentioned.
Question Order Version - Which one of two random feature orders they were assigned.

The fairness of each feature is rated as either 'Very Unfair', 'Unfair', 'Somewhat Unfair', 'Neutral', 'Somewhat Fair', 'Fair', or 'Very Fair'. Each property for each feature is labelled as 'true' if it was checked as a fairness explanation or 'false' if it was not checked. The 'Other' box for each feature was a blank text box that the responent could optionally fill in.


Second Survey Results:

Respondents were given the description for their domain, asked to rate the fairness of each feature, and asked to rate how much they agree that the features hold each property.

Domain - The respondents randomly assigned domain of rec (recidivism/bail), unem (unemployment), cps (child protective services), hos (hospital), loan, or ins (insurance).
Question Order Version - Whether the respondent was randomly assigned to be asked the fairness questions first or the property questions first.

The fairness of each feature is rated as either 'Very Unfair', 'Unfair', 'Somewhat Unfair', 'Neutral', 'Somewhat Fair', 'Fair', or 'Very Fair'. Each property for each feature is labelled as either 'Strongly Disagree', 'Disagree', 'Somewhat Disagree', 'Neutral', 'Somewhat Agree', 'Agree', or 'Strongly Agree'.
